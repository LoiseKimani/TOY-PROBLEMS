##Student Grade Generator

 </br>
   First had to first declare a variable for "result".Next had to change"result"from string to integer. In the same line had to enter a prompt for studrnt results.<br>
   Studentgrade was declared as a function.Wrote a response prompt if result is greater than 100 to indicate that number is invalid.It procedes to give feedback if any student result is entered.Result usually come in form of grade.The final line is used by the browser to provide accuracy.

##Speed detector

<br>
    This is used to show a response if a specific speed is reached.First started by declaring a function hereCar which deals with speed.<br>
    Next converted variable carSpeed from string to integer.<br>
    Defined constant demerit by the use of an equation.Added an if statement fo speed below 70 to read "OK".There was an else statement in which a number of demerits were show if the demerits were below 12.If demerits were 12 and above a statement of"License suspended was returned.I used console.log so as to run my code in the Visual studio output.

##Net salary calculator

     Started by declaring grosspay using the let variable.Converted grosspay into integer from string using parseInt 
     Started off by declaring gross pay using function.Made a lot of declarations like using let for paye,netSalary,extraTaxpay and others.Also wrote a few equations to calculate paye in various instances using different rates.
